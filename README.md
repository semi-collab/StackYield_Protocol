### Key Data Structures

- `pool-types`: Defines various pool strategies and risk levels
- `pools`: Stores active pool information and metrics
- `user-positions`: Tracks individual staking positions
- `user-stats`: Maintains user-specific statistics
- `historical-metrics`: Records pool performance over time

## Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) >= 1.0.0
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 14.0.0 (for testing)
- [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet) for deployment and interaction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/semi-collab/StackYield_Protocol.git
cd StackYield_Protocol
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
clarinet dependencies install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
clarinet build
```

## Usage

### Interacting with the Protocol

1. **Staking STX**:

```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-optimizer stake u1 u1000000 u52560)
```

2. **Checking Rewards**:

```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-optimizer calculate-rewards tx-sender u1)
```

3. **Claiming Rewards**:

```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-optimizer claim-rewards u1)
```

4. **Unstaking**:

```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-optimizer unstake u1 u1000000)
```

### For Pool Operators

1. **Creating Pool Types**:

```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-optimizer create-pool-type u1 "Conservative Pool" u2 u52560 u525600 u500)
```

2. **Creating Pools**:

```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-optimizer create-pool u1 u1 (list u100 u200 u300))
```

## Pool Types

| Type ID | Risk Level   | Min Lock | Max Lock | Base APY |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1       | Conservative | 1 week   | 1 year   | 5%       |
| 2       | Moderate     | 1 month  | 2 years  | 8%       |
| 3       | Aggressive   | 3 months | 3 years  | 12%      |

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions

- `stake`: Stake STX tokens into a pool
- `unstake`: Withdraw STX tokens from a pool
